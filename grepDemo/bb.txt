Welcome to an overview of the documentation provided by the Rust project.

This page contains links to various helpful references, 

most of which are available offline (if opened with rustup doc). 

Many of these resources take the form of “books”;

we collectively call these “The Rust Bookshelf.”

Some are large, some are small.

All of these books are managed by the Rust Organization,

but other unofficial documentation resources are included here as well!

If you’re just looking for the standard library reference, 

here it is: Rust API documentation
